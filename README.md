This is some of the code behind the [2018 CES Pre-show](https://vimeo.com/intelpr/review/250228872/716bb14dd0).

In particular:
  - Drone piano: Perhaps the world's first?
  - Piano dancers: AKA fun with interference.
  - Sophie: sensor relays for amazing real-time VFX & light control.
  - Trampoline sensors for more VFX.
